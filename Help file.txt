Version 1.4.0-f2, After Dark and Snowfall DLC compatible. 

This mod makes changes the following.
[h1]Mode of travel[/h1]
- Changes travel probability (car, bicycle, taxi) within the city, depending on age group and wealth level.

[h1]Life span[/h1]
- Lifespan spread out as a multiplier of the original
- Early death, depending on the age decile (tenth segment of the approximate life). Mapped survival values using the [url=http://www.aga.gov.au/publications/life_table_2010-12/]Australian Government Actuary table (2010-12)[/url] and imposed a decade's value to a tenth of a citizen's life

[h1]Illness[/h1]
- More people will become ill and require treatment at clincs or hospitals.

[h1]Migration[/h1]
- Enables people from a wide range of ages to migrate in, from child to seniors (yes, seniors). Partners have similar ages.
- Citizens will have a chance to have a higher (or lower) level of education that what is requested by the game.
- Teens will be at elementary school education and some young adults will be at high school education.
- Immigration greatly reduces the chance that the city has been seeded for death waves in the future.



This is created to support the mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=426163185](Realistic Population and Consumption Mod)[/url] to make the citizens life cycles feel a little more realistic.

The default mod values have been tuned for the above mod at default values. However, this mod can be used independently.


[h1] Where is the XML file? [/h1]
The XML will be first created when active on exit from a city. A file named WG_CitizenEdit.xml will appear in below directories.

Location by OS
Windows = C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines
Mac = /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines
Linux = /home/<username>/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines

Changed values in the file will be seen on loading a different city or loading from the main menu.


[h1] XML repair [/h1]
If there are any exceptions found in parsing, then that entire line in the XML will not be used and default values, or the last successfully loaded values will appear.

To return everything to defaults, delete the file before starting Cities Skylines.


[h1] Mod is NOT compatible with [/h1]
WG Travel Rebalance (is already included)
WG Lifespan Multiplier (is already included)
Randomize Age Cim Move In
Lifespan Changer
Slow Citizen Aging

[h1] Extras [/h1]
There are three presets in the source directory of the mod (Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\255710\654707599)
One is the game default (which is flat) and one for heavier car usage for low density.
There is one where car usage is based off wealth levels and is quite high.
